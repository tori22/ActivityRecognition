# ActivityRecognition
The data can be downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer 

The goal of this project is to use methods of persistence homology to (1) identify which activity is being performed and (2) discover characteristics of the participants, i.e., their state of health. 

This will be done using python and R. In R, we will make use of the TDA package. 

Here are some papers that were published based on this data:
